      "title": "What is Lei Cha?",
      "body": "The traditional method of making LeiCha is to place the tea leaves and other ingredients like ginger, sesame, peanuts, and some seasonal foods in a large grinding-earthen bowl, and then use a wooden stick to grind them, and cooked with water or brew with boiling water. Today LeiCha only exists in a few provinces in southern China, the people making Lei Cha and then enjoy it with whol family or entertain friends."

      "title": "Inheritance of Lei Cha",
      "body": "Nowadays the people who can and want to make LeiCha are mainly seniors. Learning how to make LeiCha was that every girl had to learn from her mother, and the mother hat learned from her mother. Family is the key, how the culture of LeiCha passed on. LeiCha was not only a cultural product or novel tea making processes, it is also the connection and communication between generations. So the aim of my bachelor thesis is through renew the LeiCha product, to inherit the regional culture, to awaken the yearn of homesickness, and to increase the communication between generations and the popularization for common people."

      "body": "Unfortunately, few and few young people want to learn this today. Except for the southern regions, there are less people known about this kind of tea. Most young people can only experience that, when they return to their hometown. The improving of the LeiCha making tools is focused on the following points: Modern, convenient to use, convenient to carry and store. With these several requirements, LeiCha should be accepted by more local young people and even foreigners. LeiCha culture can also develop more efÔ¨Åciently."

      "title": "ideation",
      "body": "Nowadays, young people rarely learn to make Lei cha anymore, as the process and the huge tools are a deterrent. The problem of oversized tools for making it should first be addressed to get more acceptable and usable Lei cha making tools.\n\nSo first, I reduced Lei Cha's original tool to a size that is easy to carry and store. And given different options for the shape, such as a tea set with small tools for making tea or a small bowl in which the user can crush the raw materials."

      "title": "3D print",
      "body": "The grinding process can be crushed instead of impacted. Two spheres with the same curvature, squeeze each other, the ingredients are between the two surfaces of the spheres. And by rolling the sphere, the user does not need to force the entire arm to up-down and ciecle pound, just put the palm on the sphere and turn the wrist. The radian of sphere surface can also relax the palm."

    "texture": {
      "title": "Texture and material",
      "body": "To test the effect of grinding with different grains, I made six bowls with different grains and fired them. I put about the same amount of tea leaves and sesame seeds in each bowl and ground them alternately with a wooden stick for the same amount of time. There was a slight difference in the fineness of the raw material in each bowl, but the difference was not significant.\nI conclude that grinding the ingredients in different cereal bowls for a short period of time has little effect on the fineness."

      "body": "To increase friction efficiency, both surfaces that rub against each other are made of porcelain, and the user can remove the porcelain surface from the sanding stick for cleaning.\nThe wooden ball touches the user's palm for a more comfortable feel."

    "summary": {
      "title": "summary",
      "body": "It was not all smooth sailing for me during the design and model-making process. The short time frame forced me to abandon the usual and more successful methods of using adventurous methods to make porcelain shapes. I got a lot of broken porcelain in the process and learned new ways of making it. The result was a good one.\n\nGoing back to the original intention of the thesis, when traditional culture is becoming more and more precious, I hope to pass it on with products that can bring enthusiasm to young people."
